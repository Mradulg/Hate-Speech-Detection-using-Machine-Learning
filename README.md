# Hate-Speech-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

Demonstrated the use of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for detecting hate speech on twitter data

The Dataset consisted of 24k tweets 

Bag of Words algorithm is used for vectorising the Tweets

Applied algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, Naive Bayes

Achieved accuracy: Logistic Regression(90%), Decision Tree(88.8%), KNN(79.2%), Random Forest(86.8), Naive Bayes(73.2)
